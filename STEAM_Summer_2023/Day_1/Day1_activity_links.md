# Substitution Cryptograms

An Aristocrat substitution cipher includes spaces in the text.  Try example 1

[Greg Bard Cryptograms - Aristocrat Telegram Example 1](http://gregorybard.com/GeneratedFiles/0/A.html)

Once done, try example 2

Now move on to something a little more challenging.  For this one you are given a hint but not told where the words occur:

You are now ready to fly solo.  This one still includes the spaces but there are no hints.

The Patristocrat substitution cipher does not include spaces so you have a lot less information to work with.  Try this one which does include a hint:

Here are some resources if you want to learn more about cryptography on your own:

* [Greg Bard - Cryptography](http://gregorybard.com/cryptogram.html)
Greg Bard is a former UW-Stout instructor who used to run the Code Breakers activity for Wisconsin Science Olympiad.  His website contains many more examples as well 
as resources for learning more about cryptography.

* Simon Singh. The Code Book: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It

This book is one I referenced when creating these activities.  It includes a nice history of hidden writings.
* The Black Chamber is a website by the author of The Code Book.  It contians information on many different ciphers: [The Black Chamber](Start here to figure out the key length [The Black Chamber - Vigenere](https://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/vigenere_cracking_tool.html)
* [PigPen Cipher](https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/pigpen-cipher.html#act)

Try your hand at the pigpen cipher which uses symbols instead of letters.

* The Enigma Machine on Youtube:

Numberphile has a couple of nice vidoes on how the Allies managed to crack the Enigma cipher used by the Nazis during World War II

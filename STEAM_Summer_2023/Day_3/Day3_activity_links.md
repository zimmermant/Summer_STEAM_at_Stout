## Complexity Classes
### Youtube videos on complexity classes

Up and Atom is a good channel that gets the science and math right but at a reasonable level
[P vs. NP - The Biggest Unsolved Problem in Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHp4FPyajKQ)
Start here on your journey into complexity classes.  This is a nice introduction
Also, you can earn a million dollars if you solve this problem so get cracking.

### Complexity Zoo

This website lists all the known complexity classes to date.  These are the three letter symbols we saw in The Qubit Game (e.g NP, RNC, BQP, etc)
Start with the introductory essay and then move on to the petting zoo.

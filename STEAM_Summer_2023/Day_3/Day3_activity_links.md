## Quantum Computing

### Youtube videos on quantum computing

Veritasium is a channel created by an expert in physics education.  He does a great job of breaking the physics down to a digestible level.

[How Quantum Computers Break the Internet ... Starting Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UrdExQW0cs&t=617s)

Kurzgesat - In a Nutshell is another great science channel.  They cover topics beyond just physics and I highly recommend them.

[Quantum Computers Explained - Limits of Human Technology](https://youtu.be/JhHMJCUmq28)

I like this Experts Explain at Five Different Levels series.  As your understanding grows you can come back to them and get even more understanding.

## Complexity Classes
### Youtube videos on complexity classes

Up and Atom is a good channel that gets the science and math right but at a reasonable level
[P vs. NP - The Biggest Unsolved Problem in Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHp4FPyajKQ)
Start here on your journey into complexity classes.  This is a nice introduction
Also, you can earn a million dollars if you solve this problem so get cracking.



### Complexity Zoo

This website lists all the known complexity classes to date.  These are the three letter symbols we saw in The Qubit Game (e.g NP, RNC, BQP, etc)
Start with the introductory essay and then move on to the petting zoo.

# Welcome

Congratulations, you've made it to the second day!  So far you've learned
quite a bit about encrypting and cracking classical codes, a little bit about
information theory, and a little about quantum mechanics.

Today we'll delve deeper into quantum mechanics and see how to use particles of light 
(called photons) to create a encryption key where we can tell if someone has listened
in on the key.

## BB84 Protocol

[BB83 Protocol - Challenges](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/BB84_photons/BB84_photons.html)

Go here and select "Challenges" at the top of the page.  There are six questions for you to 
show how well you've mastered quantum key distribution.

## Quander Games

This is a series of games to explore how quantum computers work.

# Going Further

# More Quander Games

There are some more levels available at Quander Games but you need parental consent (not because of anything spicy, but it was part of an NSF research project which requires people under 18 to have parental consent)

[Quantum Cryptography Explained - Physics Girl](https://youtu.be/UiJiXNEm-Go)

The Physics Girl channel is a good source for well researched and well written videos on all topics related to physics.

[What is Quantum Cryptography - Sabine Hossenfelder](https://youtu.be/fLJ9mvTS68Y)

Dr. Hossenfelder is a very no-nonsense physicist.  Very rarely do I have any issues with the physics she presents.

[BB84 with Spin 1/2 Particles](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/cryptography-bb84/Quantum_Cryptography.html)

Although we didn't talk about spin-1/2 particles, they are part of the zoo of quantum weirdness.  This simulation walks you
through how you can use these spin-1/2 particles to do QKD.

[B92 Encryption with Photons](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/cryptography-b92/B92_photons.html)

This is another example of how we can use photons to share a secret key between Alice and Bob.
